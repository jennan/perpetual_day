# Perpetual Day

This repository is a proof of concept developed during the 2025 Momentum Partnership Hackathon, trying to predict visible Himawari bands from IR bands using neural networks models, relying on [PyEarthTools](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools) for data preparation.

This code has been developed to run on NCI Gadi HPC platform, via [ARE (Australian Research Environment)](https://are.nci.org.au/) mainly.
